"""The AI console: the owner types a sentence, the platform changes something.

Two kinds of change, and the difference matters more than the feature does.

* Their dashboard is their own screen. Nobody else sees it and nothing about it
  reaches a customer, so a change applies immediately.
* Teaching the WhatsApp agent changes what an AI says to their customers. That
  is not an agent acting unsupervised -- it is the owner instructing their own
  bot, which is the human decision the approval gate exists to require. So it
  applies, but only for an owner, it is written down as an audited lesson rather
  than smeared into a prompt, and the exact wording is read back so a mistake is
  visible immediately and removable in one click.

An operator can use the console to ask questions. They cannot teach the agent
and they cannot redecorate the business's dashboard.

"dashboard". Otherwise it is "question"."""
